Generates a report on individual WooCommerce products sold during a specified time period.

== Description ==

The Product Sales Report plugin generates reports on the quantity and gross sales of individual WooCommerce products sold over a specified date range. Reports can be downloaded in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format for further analysis in your spreadsheet software, or for import into other software that supports CSV-formatted data files.

Features:

* Use a date range preset, or specify custom start and end dates.
* Report on all products in your store, or limit the report to only include products within certain categories or only specific product IDs.
* Limit the report to orders with certain statuses (e.g. Processing, Complete, or Refunded).
* Customize the report sorting order (sort by Product ID, Quantity Sold, or Gross Sales).

A [pro version](http://hearkenmedia.com/landing-wp-plugin.php?utm_source=product-sales-report&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wp-repo-upgrade-link) with the following additional features is also available:

* Report on product variations individually.
* Optionally include products with no sales (note: does not report on individual product variations with no sales).
* Report on shipping methods used (Product ID, Product Name, Quantity Sold, and Gross Sales fields only).
* Limit the report to orders with a matching custom meta field (e.g. delivery date).
* Change the names of fields in the report.
* Change the order of the fields/columns in the report.
* Include any custom field defined by WooCommerce or another plugin and associated with a product (note: custom fields associated with individual product variations are not supported at this time).
* Save multiple report presets to save time when generating different reports.
* Export in Excel (XLSX or XLS) format.
* Send the report as an email attachment.
